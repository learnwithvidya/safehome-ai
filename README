# SafeHome-AI  
**AI-Driven Security Visibility for Smart Home and IoT Networks**

---

## Overview
SafeHome-AI is a lightweight, AI-assisted security assessment tool designed to improve **visibility, awareness, and risk understanding** in smart home and small-scale IoT networks.

Unlike traditional enterprise security tools, SafeHome-AI focuses on **interpretability and usability**, enabling users to understand what devices exist in their network, how exposed they are, and where potential security risks may lie — without requiring deep cybersecurity expertise.

This project is developed as part of **AIOTICS Security Labs (ASL)** and is currently released as a **research and incubation preview**.

---

## Key Features
- Automated discovery of active devices in a local network  
- Identification of open ports and exposed services  
- Rule-based and heuristic risk assessment of devices  
- AI-assisted interpretation of security posture  
- Human-readable security reports  
- Fully local execution (no cloud dependency)  

---

## What SafeHome-AI Does *Not* Do
To ensure ethical usage and legal compliance, SafeHome-AI:

- Does **not** perform active exploitation  
- Does **not** execute intrusive attacks  
- Does **not** collect or exfiltrate user data  
- Does **not** store data on external servers  

The tool is intended strictly for **security awareness, assessment, education, and research**.

---

## Intended Users
- Smart home users seeking basic security visibility  
- Educational institutions and cybersecurity labs  
- IoT security researchers and students  
- Training programs and controlled test environments  

---

## System Architecture (High-Level)
SafeHome-AI is organized into the following logical components:

- **Scanner Module** – Network discovery and port analysis  
- **Risk Engine** – Rule-based and AI-assisted risk evaluation  
- **Report Generator** – Structured and interpretable output  
- **Web Interface** – Visualization and user interaction layer  

The design emphasizes **modularity, explainability, and low resource overhead**.
